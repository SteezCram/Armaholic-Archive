Converts binarized addon configuration files used in Armed Assault and Operation Flashpoint: Elite to human readable config.cpp format.

Note that with ArmA released only in Czech Republic so far and XboX OFP being bit difficult to mod, resulting files are not fully tested for syntax validity. They are good enough for modding research purposes though.
